# Considerations about minimalist conlangs

These should all be in:
* Issues of the repository
* latex files
* code

# What should be here
* A description of the general guidelines we
derive for the creation of minimal conlangs
* A description of a (or the) minimalist conlang
we come with given the criteria above and
chosen rules (restrictions)
* Scripts to derive structures, gadgets and analysis
of the conlangs as needed
  - DCG specifications

  - Wordnet interfaces to probe synset distributions
